##🔐 MGFN-24R Differential Cryptanalysis and Master-Key Recovery
This repository provides C and Python code for differential cryptanalysis and 128-bit master-key recovery of the 24-round MGFN-24R block cipher.
All file paths, dataset sizes, mask values, and key parameters must be set by editing variables at the top of each script or source file before running.

There is no “one-click” automation; you have full control and must configure each step
